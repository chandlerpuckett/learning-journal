# CSS

#### Color
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a bo
> If you do not specify a background color, then the background is transparent.
- use the padding property to separate text from the edges of the boxes

- ensure there is enough contrast between text and background
    - too much contrast can cause eye fatigue for long passages of text
- If text is reversed out (a light color on a dark background), you can increase the height between lines and the weight of the font to make it easier to read.

- CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements
    - The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity)

CSS3 introduces: **HUE / SATURATION / LIGHTNESS**
- **hue** is expressed as an angle (between 0 & 360 degrees)
- **saturation** is expressed as a percentage
- **lightness** is expressed as a percentage with 0 being white, 50 being normal, and 100 being black
- **alpha** (transparency) is expressed as a number between 0 and 1. 

##### The rule for the ```<body>``` element sets a default color for all the text as well as the default background color for the page. Both use color names.

##### The rule for the ```<h1>``` element sets the color of the heading using a hex code. There are two values for the background-color property of the ```<h1>``` element. The first provides a fallback color using a hex code and the second is an HSLA value for browsers that support this method

> *margin* decreases the gap between the paragraph boxes

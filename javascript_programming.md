# EXPRESSIONS & OPERATORS
- an **expression** evaluates into a single value
two types:
1. expressions that assign a value to a variable
2. expressions that use two or more values to return a single value

- expressions rely on **operators** 
    - they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
> assignment operators, arithmetic operators, string operators, comparison operators, logical operators

- assignment operators: assign a value
- arithmetic operators: perform basic math
- string operators: combine two strings
- comparison operators: compare two values and return *true* or *false*
- logical operators: combine expressions and return *true* or *false*

> There is just one string operator: the '+' symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.

> Programmers call the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string ***concatenation***.

# FUNCTIONS

>Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)

- functions also offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task

Give your function a **name**. That name should *describe the task it is performing*. When you ask it to perform its task, it is known as **calling** the function

- Pieces of information passed
to a function are known as ***parameters***.
- When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a ***return value***.

To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a **function declaration**. 
- declare using the *function keyword*. 
- give name using and identifier, followed by parentheses
- the statements that perform the task sit in a code block {curly braces}.

##### Calling a Function

To run the code in the function, you use the function name followed by parentheses. 

> You can call the same function as many times as you want within the same JavaScript file.

- when you declare the function you give it ***parameters***
    - inside the function, the parameters act like variables

- if a function needs information to work, you indicate what it needs to know in parentheses after the function name
    - these items inside the parentheses are known as the ***parameters*** of the function. 
    - parameters are used like variables within the function

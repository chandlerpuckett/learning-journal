# Javascript
- JS files should be kept seperate
- When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML ```<script>``` element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.
Its sre attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored

### Objects & Methods
- ```object.method(parameters)```
- JS runs where it is found in the HTML

# The Coders Computer

### Choosing A Text Editor
- code completion is a key feature when choosing an editor
  > saves time by displaying suggestions, automatically closing tags, quotation marks etc. so the developer can write with minimal interruption
- syntax highlighting is another key feature
  > colorizes text according to its specific attribute
- Themes! they help yr eyeballs
- It all comes down to personal preference & which editor is the most effective for ***YOU!***
   
   
##### TEXT EDITOR VS. IDE 
> IDE (Integrated Development Editor) is a full software suite which *includes* a text editor, file manager, compiler, and debugger all in one

#### Command Cheat Sheet
- Terminal Commands
  - ls: list
    - (-l) long listing
    - (/etc) lists contents of directory
    - ~ (tilde) shortcut for your home directory
    - . (dot) reference to your current directory
    - .. (dotdot) reference to the parent directory
    - (-a) shows hidden files and directories
  - tree: pulls up your directory in a lovely "tree" style format
  - code: opens VSCode
  - echo: tells user which shell you're in
  - pwd: print working directory; tells user current working directory
  - cd[location]: *change directory* used to move around in the system
    > ***If you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory***
  - file[path]: tells user the *type* of file 
  - (.) use at beginning of the name to hide a file or directory

##### KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER WHEN USING TERMINAL
- bash (bourne again shell) shell within terminal
- there must be a space between the command and the first command line argument
- first command line argument is also called an ***OPTION***
- options are used to modify behavior of the command
- Linux file systems have a hierarchical structure
- **root** is the very top of the file structure denoted with a (/)
  - *absolute* paths specify a location in relation to the root directory
  - *relative* paths specify a location in relation to where we currently are within a system 
    > ***they will not begin with a slash***
- ***LINUX IS CASE SENSITIVE***
- space on the command line is how we separate items
  - using quotes, anything inside double or single is considered a single item
  - can use an *escape character (\\)* to the same effect, it nullifys the special meaning of the character following it

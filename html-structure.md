# HTML Page Structure

### Design & Visual Hierarchy
- Ask questions about the people you would expect to be interested in the subject of your site.
- who is your target audience?
- content & design should be influenced by the ***MOTIVATIONS & GOALS*** of your users
- How often will your site need to be updated?
- What percentage of your visitors would return for regular updates on the subject, compared with those who will just need the information once?
- The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate.
> Designers create something known as a visual hierarchy
to help users focus on the key messages that will draw people's attention, and then guide them to subsequent messages    

-  You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for

### HTML5 Layout

- ```<div>``` elements have been replaced by new HTML5 layout elements
- The point of creating these new elements is so that web page authors can use them to help describe the structure of the page
> search engines might place more weight on the content in an ```<article>``` element than that in the ```<header>``` or ```<footer>``` elements
- ***VARIOUS ELEMENTS***
    - ```<header>``` and ```<footer>```
    - ```<nav>```
    - ```<article>```
    - ```<aside>```
    - ```<section>```
    - ```<hgroup>```
    - ```<figure>``` and ```<figcaption>```
    - ```<div>```
        - Where there is no suitable element to group a set of elements, the ```<div>``` element will still be used
